#  Jay Lee ⌨️

I am currently pursuing a major in Software Systems at Simon Fraser University, with a focus on C++/C programming and networking systems. 
My goal is to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms using C++ and C, as well as deepen my understanding of networking architecture
to be expert in both software development and system design.
