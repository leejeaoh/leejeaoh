"I am currently pursuing a major in Software Systems at Simon Fraser University, with a focus on C++/C programming and networking systems. 
My goal is to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms using C++/C, as well as deepen my understanding of networking architecture
to excel in both software development and system design.
